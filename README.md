This project relates to employee travel information.
I first obtain the unclean data that was provided by the team.
After that, I dealt with missing values, eliminated superfluous columns, 
and employed wrangling techniques. Use all necessary techniques 
to ensure that the data is useable.To locate outliers.
Next, I used a variety of techniques to work on central tendency, 
skewness, and correlation analysis of the data.
